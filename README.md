# Introduction

This plugin for Resharper has been developed from experiences when using the [Reactive Extensions (Rx) for .Net] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx) to develop applications using all varieties of the .Net framework.

This plugin is not about adding functionality to the Rx libraries, it's about trying to help developers write 'better' code using the Rx libraries. It's designed to highlight issues in code which could cause potential issues.

Note: Trying to define what 'better' means would be a subjective and rather futile task.


**So what's currently supported?**

Currently there are only 3 highlights and 2 quick fixes defined  - this is 'still' a beta release after all :)

See the [Wiki] (https://github.com/oriches/Resharper.ReactivePlugin/wiki) page on the wiki for an index of supported highlights, quick fixes & actions.


**Can I contribute?**

Definitely - you can either fork and generate pull requests or get in contact with a description and we'll see what we can do.
